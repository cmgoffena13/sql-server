# sql-server

A collection of SQL Server scripts that I have developed. Most internet examples are poorly formatted and named.
These are personal queries and scripts that I have written to assist myself in answering any questions I have while working with SQL Server. Most were written to provide more clarity around the state of objects and processes.
